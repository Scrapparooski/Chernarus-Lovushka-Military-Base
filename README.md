# Chernarus-Lovushka-Military-Base

This unmarked military base is northwest of Zelenogorsk and south of Myshkino. This .dze contains no deletions so putting it in should be relatively easy. Lovushka is Russian for "trap" and if you want to leave this military base you'll have to figure out how to get out.

Also included is the mapgrouppos.xml to get loot from all buildings in this build as well as the zombie territory .xml for zed spawns.

Special thanks to NoobsOnly admins LukeDuke, Mike, and Hawkeye for ideas, encouragement, testing, and hand holding.

Feel free to edit, manipulate, think obsessively about this build, and/or use this build as you see fit. I do not give permission to repack or reupload this mod.
